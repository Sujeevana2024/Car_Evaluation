Car_Evaluation_Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of car evaluations to predict a car's acceptability based on several attributes such as price, maintenance cost, number of doors, capacity, luggage space, and safety ratings. The notebook uses Python and common data science libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib to explore and visualize the data, and potentially build a predictive model.

Project Overview
-The dataset contains several features about cars, including:
-Price: e.g., 'vhigh', 'high', 'med', 'low'
-Maintenance Cost: e.g., 'vhigh', 'high', 'med', 'low'
-Number of Doors: e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5-more
-Person Capacity: e.g., 2, 4, more
-Luggage Space: e.g., small, med, big
-Safety: e.g., low, med, high
-Class: The target variable, which could be 'unacc', 'acc', 'good', or 'vgood'

Key Steps
-Data Cleaning: Ensure there are no missing values or inconsistencies in the data.
-Feature Engineering: Transform the data for modeling if necessary.
-Modeling: Build machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees,KNN Classfier , Logistic Regression) to predict car acceptability.

#Libraries Used
-pandas
-numpy
